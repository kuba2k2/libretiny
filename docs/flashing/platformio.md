# Flashing PlatformIO projects

PlatformIO projects developed with LibreTiny can be flashed just like any other PIO project.

!!! abstract
	All binary files generated by PlatformIO will be in `.pio/build/<my_board>/`. The methods described below may require you to get a file from that directory.

	This path will be referred to as **build directory**.

## Built-in flasher

LibreTiny has a built-in firmware uploader, based on [ltchiptool](tools/ltchiptool.md). Pressing `Upload` in PlatformIO IDE does all the work for you.

If you have more than one COM port, configure your PIO project first:

```ini title="platformio.ini"
[env:my_board]
monitor_port = COM96
upload_port = COM96
```

{%
	include-markdown "inc/uart-info.md"
%}

{%
	include-markdown "inc/uart-ltchiptool.md"
%}
