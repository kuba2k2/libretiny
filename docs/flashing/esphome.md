# Flashing ESPHome

ESPHome can be flashed in few different ways, depending on your needs.

!!! abstract
	All binary files generated by ESPHome will be in `.esphome/build/<yourdevice>/.pioenvs/<yourdevice>/`. The methods described below may require you to get a file from that directory.

	If you're using the GUI (ESPHome Dashboard) this path will be in your `configs/` directory.

	This path will be referred to as **build directory**.

## Built-in flasher

=== "CLI"

	The flasher program built-in LibreTiny is also available for ESPHome.

	- use `python -m esphome run yourdevice.yml` to recompile AND upload the firmware
	- use `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml` to upload without recompiling

	%}

	If your device is already running ESPHome, refer to the OTA guide below.

=== "GUI"

	The built-in flasher is not yet available in the GUI. Here are your options:

	- OTA, using the downloaded UF2 file (if you're already running ESPHome)
	- wired (also UF2), using ltchiptool
	- wirelessly, using tuya-cloudcutter

	Read below for more details on each of these methods.

## Over-the-Air (OTA)

This method requires having ESPHome already installed on your device.

- If you've added the Web Server component, navigate to the device's IP address (or `.local` name) in your web browser. Grab `firmware.uf2` from the build directory and drop it on the "OTA Update" field.
- You can also use ESPHome CLI to flash via OTA. Add a `--device` argument to the command, as such: `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml --device yourdevice.local`
