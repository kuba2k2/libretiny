## Converting devices with tuya-cloudcutter

!!! note
	This currently applies to BK7231T and BK7231N only. `tuya-cloudcutter` can't be used for other chips.

Grab the `image_bk7231x_app.ota.ug.bin` file from the build directory - take care to choose the correct file. It must have "OTA" and "UG" in its name.

Next, refer to [Using tuya-cloudcutter](../tools/cloudcutter.md) guide.
