# ESPHome

!!! important
	Read [Getting started](../getting-started/README.md) first.

	**It is very important that you have the latest version of LibreTuya installed** (not `libretuya-esphome`) **so that you don't face issues that are already resolved**.

## Install ESPHome

Because ESPHome does not natively support running on non-ESP chips, you need to use a fork of the project.

Assuming you have PlatformIO, git and Python installed:

1. Open a terminal/cmd.exe, create `esphome` directory and `cd` into it.
2. `git clone https://github.com/kuba2k2/libretuya-esphome -b platform/libretuya` (you need the `platform/libretuya` branch)

!!! note
	For Linux users (or if `python -m esphome` doesn't work for you):

	- unistall ESPHome first: `pip uninstall esphome`
	- install the forked version: `pip install -e .`

## Create your device config

1. Go to [Boards & CPU list](../status/supported/), click on your board and remember your board code.
2. Create a YAML config file for your device. You can either:
	- use `python -m esphome wizard yourdevice.yml` - type answers to the six questions the wizard asks, OR:
	- if your board isn't available in the wizard yet, use the manual YAML method below
	- write a config file manually:
		```yaml
		esphome:
		  name: yourdevice

		libretuya:
		  board: wr3  # THIS IS YOUR BOARD CODE
		  framework:
		  	version: latest

		logger:
		api:
		  password: ""
		ota:
		  password: ""

		wifi:
		  ssid: "YourWiFiSSID"
		  password: "SecretPa$$w0rd"
		  ap:
		    ssid: "Yourdevice Fallback Hotspot"
		    password: "Dv2hZMGZRUvy"
		```

## Configuration options

All options from [Options & config](../reference/config.md) can be customized in the `libretuya:` block:

```yaml
libretuya:
  framework:
    version: latest
  lt_config:
    LT_LOG_HEAP: 1
	LT_UART_DEFAULT_PORT: 2
	LT_UART_SILENT_ALL: 0
```
(this is only an example)

Additionally, few options have their dedicated keys:

```yaml
libretuya:
  framework:
    version: latest
  # verbose/trace/debug/info/warn/error/fatal
  loglevel: warn
  # suppress chip's SDK log messages
  # (same as LT_UART_SILENT_ALL above)
  sdk_silent: true
  # disable SWD/JTAG so that all GPIOs can be used
  # set to false if you want to attach a debugger
  gpio_recover: true
```
(these values are defaults)

## Compile & upload

- `python -m esphome compile yourdevice.yml` - this will only compile the code
- `python -m esphome upload yourdevice.yml` - this will upload the previously compiled code
- `python -m esphome run yourdevice.yml` - this will compile and upload the code

!!! info
	If you want to flash manually:

	The binary file, ready for uploading, will be in `.esphome/build/yourdevice/.pioenvs/yourdevice/`.

	Refer to your board README to find appropriate flashing instructions.

	Or [flash with `tuya-cloudcutter`](../getting-started/cloudcutter.md).
